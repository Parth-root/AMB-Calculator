 To use the calculator, please follow the steps given below:

- Select your account Scheme. AMB(Average Monthly Balance) required for the scheme will be displayed on screen.
- Select a date and Enter the balance amount for that day (end of day balance). 
        
    - Repeat this for all dates of the month on which transactions have been made. 
    <!-- Days having same closing balance should be combinely selected. -->
- In the account summary, you will be able to see the details of inputs provided by you. 

- Calculator will display existing average balance for the month as well as average balance to be maintained in the remaining days of the month for not getting a fine.


## TODO list

- [ ] Make the Graphical User Interfaces look better
- [ ] Calendar Implementation (Now it's 31 days)
- [ ] Min Balance User Input 

This code was put together in about 4 hours, so it's not necessarily complete and the prettiest!
